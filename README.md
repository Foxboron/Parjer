# parjer

A very basic IRCBot in Clojure.

## Usage

```clojure
{:nick "Cjoey"
 :server "irc.codetalk.io"
 :port 6667
 :chan "#lobby"
 :owner #{Foxboron}
 :mark "@"}
```
The setup file should be simple enough.

The bot itself got some basic commands:
* eval
    Uses clojail to sandbox the input. You need a `~/.java.policy` file to use this feature.
* dice
    Returns 4. I am 100% sure this is a random number.
* say
    Return what ever typed into it.
* join
    Joins a channel.
* part
    Parts a channel
